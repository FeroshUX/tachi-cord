  [ --THEME STYLES-- ]
  Below are the available styles that you can enable. Please make sure that you
  comment out th current enabled style, then uncomment the style that you want
  to enable.
  
  
  [ --BASIC HOW-TO-- ]
  Comments in SCSS use //, but you can also just use the default CSS comments. You
  should use these to comment out the style that you are currently using in order
  to disable it. After that, find the style that you want to enable by removing the
  comment from it.

  Please note that you CANNOT have two styles enabled, well you can but something
  probably will break if you do. Also, you HAVE to have a style enabled, otherwise
  stuff just completely breaks.
