  [ --THEME STYLES-- ]
  Below are the available styles that you can enable. Please make sure that you
  comment out th current enabled style, then uncomment the style that you want
  to enable.
  
  
  [ --BASIC HOW-TO-- ]
  Find the current style that is in use, and comment it out. Afterwards, uncomment
  the style that you wish to use.

  Please note that you CANNOT have two styles enabled, well you can but something
  probably will break if you do. Also, you HAVE to have a style enabled, otherwise
  stuff just completely breaks.
